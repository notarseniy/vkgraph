VKGraph
===============

Library for generating .gexf file (that can be visualized in [Gephi](https://gephi.org/), for example) from VK.

## TODO
- [ ] Same functionality as original app (1 & 2-depth graphs)
- [x] Optimizations for VK API
- [ ] Fix some attributes
- [ ] Queried graph (for example: graph of students of MIREA University)

Based on @kolen's work â€” https://github.com/kolen/vk-graph-export
